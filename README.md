# Cybersecurity Final Project - Advanced Port Scanner

## Created by
Matt Sullivan and Jonathan Trejo

# About
The Advanced Port Scanner helps analyze the users system for potential vulnerabilities by getting an IP and scanning the ports within a user defined range. The program is built using Python.

## Usage
1. Type in the name of the IP address that you want to scan. Typically, on a local system you would want to just type in localhost.
2. Choose the starting port and ending port that you would want to scan.
3. Click the submit button or press enter
4. Wait for the process to finish
5. The output will show in a list to the side
6. Clicking on a line in the list will bring up the respective information for that port, including its usage and vulnerability information.

## Supported Platforms
Any system running Python 3, specifically 3.6 will be able to run this program

## System requirements
